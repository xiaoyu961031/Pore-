Welcome to the Pore+ Encoder repository, an enhanced feature engineering tool for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that builds upon traditional pore descriptors. The Pore+ encoder provides a refined set of descriptors designed to capture both the geometric and chemical heterogeneity of MOF pore spaces, enabling accurate and interpretable machine learning predictions for applications such as gas capture and separation.

Pore+ offers three key groups of descriptors: curated traditional geometric descriptors (Geo*), multi-probe-visited geometry (mpv-Geo), and advanced surface area metrics (SA). These descriptors aim to address the limitations of conventional pore features by incorporating more nuanced characterizations of the pore environment, including elementally and atom-type-specific contributions to surface area.

The Pore+ descriptors have been used successfully to predict selective adsorption of methyl iodide (CH‚ÇÉI) in MOFs, demonstrating improved model accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional descriptors. By providing a detailed representation of pore features, Pore+ helps researchers understand the critical factors driving adsorption performance and supports the rational design of new MOFs with optimized properties.
